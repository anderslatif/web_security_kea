Reflected XSS (Also called: Non-persistent XSS)

can occur when user-input is displayed un-encoded

Example: echo "<p>"$_GET["name"]


Stored XSS (Persisted XSS)

Malicious code is stored in the db

Everyone that views the output of the database risks being a victim

CSRF - Cross-site Request Forgery

How to defend: referer on the header
if the referer field shows that it's coming from a wrong ip then it's a CSRF

or token...
