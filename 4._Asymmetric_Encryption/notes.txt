xss can do session hijacking and forced rediretion

hashes are used for:
1. Verifying data integrity
2. Storing Passwords

Salting a hash is a good idea to improve security and avod same password problem

Rainbow tables - lookup table of prehashed passwords

Bcrypt and others have  a salt built in

Encryption: securing a message through a non-secure channel

Symmetric encryption: Anyone who gets the key has access to the secret
Solution: Share a new key on a new channel

Asymmetric key encryption: uses 2 keys: mathematically related but can't be calculated from each other
2 keys: Private and public key

Hashing is a fixed size and a one way function.
Encryption depends on the message size.

Can we trust a public key? The answer is certificates.
Issued by certificate authorities (CA)


RCA (Root Certificate Authorities)
