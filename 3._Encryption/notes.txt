Security goals (CIA) - Confidentiality Integrity Availability

Confidentiality: Prevent anauthorised access to information

Integrity: Prevent unauthorised altering of information

Availability: Ensure the availability of the system for authorised uses

-------
Hashing strength

Time to generate (cycles to cost)

Preimage resistance

Collision

------

CrackStation.net -> rainbow tables

Hashed password and Salt is stored in the db
Pepper is stored in the code (like a key)

type.cost.salt.password

Algorithms available: Blowfish, twofish, AES (rijdael), 3DES

------

Block encryption modes

ECB - electronic codebook mode

CBC - cipher block chaining mode (Initialization Vector, see it as a salt) cyclic block chaining

OFB - output feedback mode (similar to CBC but more error rsistant)

-----

In order to decrypt message the following is needed:

* Cyphertext
* Key
* IV (not required)
* encryption algorithm and block encryption mode
