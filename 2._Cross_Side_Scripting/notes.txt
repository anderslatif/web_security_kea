The difference between http 1.0 and 1.1 is that you can have multiple host names (domain names) on the same server

----------
HTTP Headers

Host - Hostnaame requested

in HTTP 1.1 the cookie is retransmitted with every request

Origin - used by AJAX for cros domain request

Referer [optional] - The page form where the request originates

User-Agent - What browser or application that acts as a client
    You can store the session there. if the user uses the same browser then....

---------
HTTP Response headers

Server - Information about the server (OS, webserver etc.)

Location - Used for redirecting client to a new location

Access-Control-Allow-Origin - Used for Ajax

Set Cookie -  Issues a cookie to client

--------

HTTP Status code
Some browsers don't send the text with the code. So some attackers use this to check info about what browser the user is using or more info.

--------

Encryption takes a plain text and converts it to an encrypted text using a key and an encryption algorithm. The resulting encrypted text can later be decrypted (by using the same key and algorithm).

A digest takes a plain text and generates a hashcode which can be used to verify if the plain text is unmodified but cannot be used to decrypt the original text from the hash value.
